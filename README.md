# Trivia Quiz Program in C++

## Overview

This C++ program implements a trivia quiz game that displays multiple-choice questions, accepts user answers, and provides a final score along with the correct answers. The game reads trivia questions from a text file, presents them to the user, and calculates a score based on their answers. The program also allows users to request hints for each question, reducing the score for that particular question if the hint is used.

**Problem Description**

The program prompts the user to input a filename containing trivia questions and the number of questions to attempt (1-10). It reads the questions, choices, correct answer keys, and hints from the file, and asks the user to answer each question. At the end of the quiz, it displays the correct answers and the user's score.

**Features**

- Multiple-choice trivia questions (A, B, C, D)
- Option to ask for a hint (penalty of -5 points per hint)
- Final score calculation based on user input
- Displays the answer key at the end
- Question Class

The Question class is the core of this trivia game, representing each trivia question. The class contains:


Private Member Variables:

- A stem for the question text
- An array of 4 possible answers
- A hint to help the user
- The correct answer key (A, B, C, or D)
- The point value (initially set to 10 points)

## How the Program Works

- Input: The user enters the filename containing the questions and the number of questions to attempt.
- Quiz: The program reads each question from the file, displays it, and asks the user for their answer (or a hint). If the user asks for a hint, the score for that question is reduced.
- Output: At the end of the quiz, the program displays the correct answers and the userâ€™s score.
